[{"content":"The third meetup was executed successfully, still amazing that we can gather almost 40 people under one roof to talk all things OSS and cloud native.\nA big thanks to Björn, Falko, and Fredrik for their talks, and to everyone else for your participation and great questions.\nPrevious Next Björn Johansson – The Context Layer: Platform Engineering in the Age of AI # Björn walked us through what happens to platform engineering when LLMs start becoming primary consumers of your platform. He explored how we can expose platform knowledge to agents without cluttering the context window—super relevant as AI tools move deeper into our workflows.\nFredrik Steen – When Your Cloud Won’t Do UDP: Building a K8s Node Watcher # Fredrik shared a hands-on story about building a Kubernetes node watcher when UDP simply wasn’t an option. A fun, technical deep dive into problem-solving under constraints.\nFalko Flessner – Similarities Between Containers and Mainframes # Falko took us on a jolly walk through the conceptual parallels between modern containers/cloud infrastructure and classic mainframes. From long-lasting compatibility approaches to the renaissance of storage layers, he highlighted where the old ideas still shine today.\nA huge thanks once again to Redpill Linpro for sponsoring and hosting the event.\nLooking forward to the next meetup in Q1 2026.\nIf you want to contribute, please reach out to leo@redpill-linpro.com.\n","date":"13 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"Welcome to my image gallery!
