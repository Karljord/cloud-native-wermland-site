[{"content":"Varnish Software welcomes everyone to the fourth Cloud Native Wermland meetup in Karlstad! Meet like-minded people, talk about cloud native and open solutions, and make new connections over food and drinks. The event is open to everyone – regardless of previous experience or knowledge level.\nMars Meetup Register Now Speakers # Speaker: Johan Westin\nTitle: Crack it open\nSummary Lets open up some container images and look inside to understand how they work. And maybe we might even learn some tricks when creating those Dockerfiles.\nSpeaker: Falko Flessner\nTitle: Assessing Long-Term Availability Of Open-Source-Software\nSummary: Within a month, MinIO went to a maintenance-only mode and ingress-nginx was discontinued. With these two widely used OSS projects suddenly being unavailable, the question is how to assess the long-term availability of Open-Source projects? By a structured analysis of both failed and greatly successful projects, we will see which organizational factors influence longevity or the risk of a project being discontinued. Looking at the failed projects also allows us to have fun while expanding our vocabulary of swear words of varying appropriateness.\nSpeaker: David Hall\nTitle: Digital sovereignty.\nSummary: What does digital sovereignty actually mean in practice, beyond buzzwords and policy documents? This talk looks at control, transparency, and long-term resilience in cloud and platform choices. We will explore how open source, data location, vendor lock-in, and operational autonomy intersect, and where the trade-offs really are. Expect practical examples, a few uncomfortable questions, and some concrete takeaways on how to build systems you actually own and understand.\n","date":"12 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"homepage"},{"content":"Cloud Native Wermland is a local community dedicated to sharing knowledge, experiences, and inspiration around cloud native technologies, the CNCF ecosystem, and open source.\nOur mission is to strengthen the local tech scene in Värmland by connecting developers, engineers, architects, students, and companies who share an interest in modern infrastructure, containers, Kubernetes, DevOps practices, and the open source projects that power today’s cloud-native world.\nWe organize around four meetups per year, where members can listen to talks from local and invited speakers, showcase their own projects, and network with others in the community. Each event offers an open and welcoming atmosphere, whether you’re just starting your journey or already deep into the cloud native landscape.\nBeyond the meetups, we stay connected through our LinkedIn group and Slack channel, where discussions continue, collaborations form, and new ideas take shape. These platforms are great for sharing resources, asking questions, or finding others to hack, build, and learn with.\nJoin Cloud Native Wermland to be part of a growing local movement that celebrates open source collaboration and helps bring the global cloud native conversation closer to home.\n","date":"12 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About Cloud Native Wermland","type":"about"},{"content":"","date":"10 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/events/","section":"Events","summary":"","title":"Events","type":"events"},{"content":"Thank you all for attending the September meetup, hosted by our wonderful colleagues and friends at Varnish Software.

He explored how we can expose platform knowledge to agents without cluttering the context window—super relevant as AI tools move deeper into our workflows.\nFredrik Steen – When Your Cloud Won’t Do UDP: Building a K8s Node Watcher # Fredrik shared a hands-on story about building a Kubernetes node watcher when UDP simply wasn’t an option. A fun, technical deep dive into problem-solving under constraints.\nFalko Flessner – Similarities Between Containers and Mainframes # Falko took us on a jolly walk through the conceptual parallels between modern containers/cloud infrastructure and classic mainframes. From long-lasting compatibility approaches to the renaissance of storage layers, he highlighted where the old ideas still shine today.\nA huge thanks once again to Redpill Linpro for sponsoring and hosting the event.\nLooking forward to the next meetup in Q1 2026.\nIf you want to contribute, please reach out to leo@redpill-linpro.com.\n","date":"15 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/events/meetup-nov-2025/","section":"Events","summary":"","title":"November 2025 Meetup","type":"article"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contributors/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Contributors","type":"custom"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sponsors/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Sponsors and hosts","type":"custom"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
