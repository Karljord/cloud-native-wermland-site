**Cloud Native Wermland** is a local community dedicated to sharing knowledge, experiences, and inspiration around **cloud native technologies**, the **CNCF ecosystem**, and **open source**.

Our mission is to strengthen the local tech scene in Värmland by connecting developers, engineers, architects, students, and companies who share an interest in modern infrastructure, containers, Kubernetes, DevOps practices, and the open source projects that power today’s cloud-native world.

We organize **around four meetups per year**, where members can listen to talks from local and invited speakers, showcase their own projects, and network with others in the community. Each event offers an open and welcoming atmosphere, whether you’re just starting your journey or already deep into the cloud native landscape.

Beyond the meetups, we stay connected through our **LinkedIn group** and **Slack channel**, where discussions continue, collaborations form, and new ideas take shape. These platforms are great for sharing resources, asking questions, or finding others to hack, build, and learn with.

Join **Cloud Native Wermland** to be part of a growing local movement that celebrates open source collaboration and helps bring the global cloud native conversation closer to home.
