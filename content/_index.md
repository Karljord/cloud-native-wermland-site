## Speakers

**Speaker:** Johan Westin

**Title:** *Crack it open*

**Summary**
Lets open up some container images and look inside to understand how they work. And maybe we might even learn some tricks when creating those Dockerfiles.

**Speaker:** Falko Flessner

**Title:** *Assessing Long-Term Availability Of Open-Source-Software*  


**Summary:**
Within a month, MinIO went to a maintenance-only mode and ingress-nginx was discontinued. With these two widely used OSS projects suddenly being unavailable, the question is how to assess the long-term availability of Open-Source projects? By a structured analysis of both failed and greatly successful projects, we will see which organizational factors influence longevity or the risk of a project being discontinued. Looking at the failed projects also allows us to have fun while expanding our vocabulary of swear words of varying appropriateness.

**Speaker:** David Hall

**Title:** *Digital sovereignty*. 


**Summary:**
What does digital sovereignty actually mean in practice, beyond buzzwords and policy documents? This talk looks at control, transparency, and long-term resilience in cloud and platform choices. We will explore how open source, data location, vendor lock-in, and operational autonomy intersect, and where the trade-offs really are. Expect practical examples, a few uncomfortable questions, and some concrete takeaways on how to build systems you actually own and understand.
