Thank you all for attending the September meetup, hosted by our wonderful colleagues and friends at Varnish Software. It was fantastic to see such a great turnout, it’s truly inspiring to gather such a large and engaged audience here in our region.

A special thanks goes out to Pontus Ullgren, Fredrik Steen, and David Karlsson for their valuable contributions and support in making this event a success.
