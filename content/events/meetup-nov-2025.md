The third meetup was executed successfully, still amazing that we can gather almost 40 people under one roof to talk all things OSS and cloud native.

A big thanks to **Björn, Falko, and Fredrik** for their talks, and to everyone else for your participation and great questions.

### Björn Johansson – *The Context Layer: Platform Engineering in the Age of AI*
Björn walked us through what happens to platform engineering when LLMs start becoming primary consumers of your platform. He explored how we can expose platform knowledge to agents without cluttering the context window—super relevant as AI tools move deeper into our workflows.

### Fredrik Steen – *When Your Cloud Won’t Do UDP: Building a K8s Node Watcher*
Fredrik shared a hands-on story about building a Kubernetes node watcher when UDP simply wasn’t an option. A fun, technical deep dive into problem-solving under constraints.

### Falko Flessner – *Similarities Between Containers and Mainframes*
Falko took us on a jolly walk through the conceptual parallels between modern containers/cloud infrastructure and classic mainframes. From long-lasting compatibility approaches to the renaissance of storage layers, he highlighted where the old ideas still shine today.

A huge thanks once again to **Redpill Linpro** for sponsoring and hosting the event.

Looking forward to the next meetup in **Q1 2026**.
